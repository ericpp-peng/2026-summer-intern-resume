Technologies & Tools: Linux, TCP/IP, SQLite, Makefile, I2C, UART, GitLab(CI/CD pipelines), Docker, Jira
● Protocol Gateways (based on Linux):
Achieved USD 3M/year revenue with +10% YoY growth (2021 - 2024)
o Led modularization of the IEC 60870-5-101/104 protocol stack for MGate 5192, reducing integration time for
new products by over 50% through collaboration with front-end, PM, and SQA teams
o Built a customized full-stack solution for MGate 5216, enabling customer onboarding and reducing debugging
time between software R&D and clients by over 90%
o Improved the RESTful library for the MGate 5000 series using an IPC-based design, reducing API maintenance
and development time by 10%
o Developed unit tests and valgrind scripts for MGate 5000 series software modules integrated with GitLab CI,
enhancing system stability and enabling early detection of memory issues with 90% test coverage
o Co-developed the SD card backup module with the Linux kernel team and independently resolved issues
through kernel source code analysis
● Media Converters (based on MCUs):
o Led the software development of IMC-P21A-G2 (Ethernet-to-fiber) from project initiation to market launch,
collaborating with HW, PM, and SQA teams
o Resolved sample point and communication issues for Japanese clients using ICF-1171I (CAN-to-fiber)
